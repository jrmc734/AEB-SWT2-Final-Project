 {\bfseries{AEB}} is an advanced active safety system that assists drivers in avoiding or mitigating collisions with other vehicles or obstacles. It detects potential frontal collisions and automatically engages the vehicle\textquotesingle{}s braking system to reduce speed or come to a complete stop, aiming to prevent or minimize impact.

To implement this system, {\bfseries{POSIX}} (Portable Operating System Interface) concepts are employed. POSIX defines programming interfaces and operating system interfaces to maintain compatibility between different operating systems, facilitating portability and interoperability of applications.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Project Objective}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
This project is part of the final course in Automotive Propulsion Engineering, aka {\bfseries{Residência Tecnológica Stellantis 2024, SWT2}}. It is dedicated to the development of an Automotive Emergency Braking (AEB) system, aligning with Stellantis’ interests. The project takes a multidisciplinary approach, demonstrating the student\textquotesingle{}s understanding of various topics covered during the course. Key topics include Vehicle Modeling and Simulation, Agile Methodologies, Vehicular Networks, Vehicle Function Allocation, Automotive Embedded Software Modeling and Testing, and the Implementation of Automotive Control Systems.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Main Features}\label{index_autotoc_md2}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Collision Detection}}\+: Continuous monitoring of the vehicle\textquotesingle{}s frontal environment to identify potential imminent collisions.
\item {\bfseries{Automatic Braking Activation}}\+: In the event of a collision risk detection, the system automatically engages the brakes to reduce speed or stop the vehicle.
\item {\bfseries{Driver Notifications}}\+: Visual and audible alerts to inform the driver about potential hazards and actions taken by the system.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Technologies Used}\label{index_autotoc_md3}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Programming Language}}\+: C, leveraging POSIX-\/compatible libraries and system calls to ensure portability and efficiency.
